    Took ownership of the ‘jewel’ in the scheduling solution : the mobile app.

    Always improving the functionality of it, adding new features, improving the user experience and generally, adding features on mobile first, before they are rolled to the rest of the solution. 

    I’ve taken responsibility for the architecture, build and maintenance of it. With a primary focus on the mobile app but, since I’m passionate about how tech can solve problems I was welcomed to work on web app and API development too (C#).
