    During the course I learned how to independently or integrated in a team, be able to plan, implement, manage and maintain operations of a Data Center, optimizing its operation, ensuring the availability of services based on Cloud computing as well as critical systems in order to ensure the continuity of business processes.

    Design, develop, install, configure and manage a software system including access to databases, following best practices for collaborative development and security, in accordance with requirements, applicable legislation and international standards.

    Unfortunately I could not complete the degree due to personal reasons and because the course no longer exists after 2017.
